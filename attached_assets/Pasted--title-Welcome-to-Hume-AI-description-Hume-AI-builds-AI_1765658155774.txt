  **Octave 2 (preview) and EVI 4-mini are live**! Expanded language support and lower latency for faster, more natural responses. [Learn more](https://www.hume.ai/blog/octave-2-launch).
</Launch>

**Hume is a research lab and technology company** with a mission to ensure that artificial intelligence is built to
serve human goals and emotional well-being.

Hume develops two categories of models: speech-language models that interpret and generate expressive speech, and
expression measurement models that analyze vocal, facial, and verbal expression.

These models are available through three APIs: the Empathic Voice Interface (EVI) for real-time voice
interaction, Text-to-Speech (TTS) for expressive speech synthesis, and Expression 
Measurement for analyzing expression in media and text.


### [Speech-to-Speech (EVI)](/docs/speech-to-speech-evi/overview)

Hume's Empathic Voice Interface (EVI) is an advanced, real-time emotionally intelligent voice AI. EVI measures users'
nuanced vocal modulations and responds to them using a speech-language model, which guides language and speech
generation. Trained on millions of human interactions, our speech-language model unites language modeling and
text-to-speech with better EQ, prosody, end-of-turn detection, interruptibility, and alignment.

### [Text-to-Speech (TTS)](/docs/text-to-speech-tts/overview)

Octave TTS is the first text-to-speech system built on LLM intelligence. Unlike conventional TTS that merely "reads"
words, Octave is a "speech-language model" that understands what words mean in context, unlocking a new level of
expressiveness and nuance.

### [Expression Measurement](/docs/expression-measurement/overview) [#expression-measurement]

Hume's state-of-the-art expression measurement models for the voice, face, and language are built on 10+ years of
research and advances in semantic space theory pioneered by Alan Cowen. Our expression measurement models are able to
capture hundreds of dimensions of human expression in audio, video, and images.

### [Voice](/docs/voice/overview)

Voice defines how speech is delivered, shaping tone, pacing, accent, and personality. It plays a central role in how
listeners perceive meaning and emotion.

All voices in Hume's platform are powered by **Octave**, a speech-language model built on LLM intelligence. Octave enables
expressive, context-aware speech generation from both text and natural language descriptions. 

Voices can be used across both **EVI** and **TTS** to tailor how content is spoken.
